abstract: "This paper presents Hausa WordNet (HWN), a lexical resource for Hausa language. The HWN extracts knowledge from a conventional Hausa dictionary and adopts a substructure of English and Hindi WordNet as it groups words based on different categories. The HWN Introduces pronunciation and the use of close class categories (CCC) to address the problem of missing pronunciation and coverage from existing WordNets. HWN is evaluated in comparison with existing WordNets (English and Hindi). The performance results show that HWN performs better ."
