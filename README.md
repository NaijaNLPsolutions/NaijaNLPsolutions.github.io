## Our Mission

At **Naija NLP Solutions**, we are dedicated to revolutionizing communication by building cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies for Nigerian languages, especially those that are low-resourced. Our goal is to ensure that these languages are represented in modern technological solutions, bridging the gap for communities who are often left behind.

## ![Mission Icon](https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/000000/goal.png) Why We Exist

Nigeria is home to over 500 languages, but the majority of these are underrepresented in the digital world. Major technological solutions, including machine translation, chatbots, and virtual assistants, are often unavailable for many Nigerian languages, making communication, accessibility, and information retrieval challenging.

At Naija NLP Solutions, we are on a mission to change that. By leveraging the latest advancements in AI, we create robust NLP models that are tailored for Nigerian languages, enabling users to:

- Communicate in their native language.
- Access information through virtual assistants and chatbots.
- Benefit from machine translation tools that cater to their specific needs.

## ![Focus Icon](https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/000000/focus.png) Our Focus

We are committed to building tools for the following areas:

### 1. ![Translation Icon](https://img.icons8.com/external-flat-juicy-fish/60/000000/external-translation-languages-and-translation-flat-flat-juicy-fish.png) Machine Translation  
We develop translation models that help translate between Nigerian languages and other major languages. This enables easier communication, education, and access to information.

### 2. ![Chatbot Icon](https://img.icons8.com/color/60/000000/chatbot.png) Chatbots  
Our chatbots are designed to interact in local languages, providing users with real-time assistance and answers in their preferred language. These bots can be integrated into customer support, healthcare, and educational platforms.

### 3. ![Virtual Assistant Icon](https://img.icons8.com/fluency/60/000000/voice-id.png) Virtual Assistants  
Imagine a virtual assistant that understands and speaks your native language. Our solutions help bring this to life for low-resource Nigerian languages, making technology more accessible and user-friendly.

## ![Languages Icon](https://img.icons8.com/fluency/64/000000/language.png) Why Nigerian Languages Matter

Each Nigerian language carries its own rich cultural heritage, values, and knowledge. However, many of these languages are classified as low-resource, meaning they lack the data necessary to train high-quality language models. We focus on languages such as Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and more underrepresented ones like Nupe, Tiv, Fulfulde, Gbagyi, and Idoma, giving these languages the voice they deserve in the digital age.

### 1. Data Collection & Curation  
We gather high-quality text and speech data from native speakers to create datasets that represent the linguistic richness of Nigerian languages. Our [NaijaCodeSWI project](#) aims to create a benchmark code-switch text and speech dataset for Nigerian languages.

### 2. Collaborative Research  
We partner with researchers, universities, and communities to co-create solutions that are practical, relevant, and impactful. Our goal is to bring academia, industry, and local communities together for the advancement of language technologies.

### 3. Innovative NLP Techniques  
Using the latest in unsupervised, self-supervised, and transfer learning models, we focus on building multilingual NLP systems that work effectively with minimal data. Our work includes the development of custom architectures to handle code-switching and multilingual environments common in Nigeria.
